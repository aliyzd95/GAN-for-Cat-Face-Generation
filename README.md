# GAN for Cat Face Generation

In this project, I implemented a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate realistic images of cat faces from random noise. The main goal of this project is to understand the fundamental concepts of GANs, including the Generator and Discriminator components, and to explore how these networks can learn and generate complex data distributions.

### Project Overview
GANs are a class of machine learning models capable of learning complex data distributions and generating new data samples that resemble the original data. In this project, I used a GAN to model the distribution of cat face images and generate new, realistic-looking images.

### Key Components
- **Generator (G):** Takes a random noise vector as input and generates an image that resembles a cat face.
- **Discriminator (D):** Takes an image as input (either from the real dataset or generated by the Generator) and predicts whether the image is real or fake.
- **Adversarial Loss:** Both networks are trained simultaneously. The Generator aims to fool the Discriminator into thinking generated images are real, while the Discriminator tries to correctly distinguish between real and fake images.

### Model Parameters
- **Noise vector size:** 100
- **Learning rate:** 0.0002
- **Image size:** 256x256 (RGB)
- **Batch size:** 64
- **Epochs:** Minimum of 20

### Training and Results
The model was trained for a minimum of 20 epochs to optimize both the Generator and Discriminator. Throughout the training, the Generator progressively learns to generate more realistic images, and the Discriminator improves in distinguishing real from fake images.

### Key Insights
This project helped me understand the underlying mechanics of GANs and provided practical experience in implementing them. It was also a great way to explore how deep learning models can be used for image generation tasks, particularly in a creative context like generating cat faces.

Feel free to check out the code, experiment with the model, and see how the generated images evolve as training progresses!
